Lauderdale is an iconic facility. And though most believe it needs a complete rebuild, or at least a good facelift I love being on that deck.<br><strong>G:</strong> I would find it hard NOT to be inspired training at the Hall of Fame pool.  Unfortunately for us, the weather wasn't that great while we were there, but I can imagine watching the sunrise during morning practice is beautiful.  TONS of water, so there certainly wasn't any over-crowding in the lanes.  Very luxurious lane space.</p><p><strong>What we thought of the coach to swimmer ratio:<br>R:</strong>  This team is still in a building up process, as it is only a few years old. This means the lanes are not overcrowded, the group sizes are manageable and the coaches are plentiful. So, anyone who is on this team is lucky to have such a low coach to swimmer ratio.<br><strong>G:</strong> Very good coverage for the group size.  The only thing I can say is that sometimes having SO much room makes it a bit tougher on the group in the middle of the short-course pool.  Getting from one end to the other, means having to walk a long way around.</p><p><strong>Was there practical application of skills during practice:<br>R: </strong> Not only did the coaches integrate skills into their training but Dave and Jennifer Gibson we're excited for anything new/different we could offer during our visit. This means that these coaches are not only teaching good things but also constantly learning and growing.<br><strong>G:</strong> Another team using the push-off markers.  NOTHING is more important for competitive swimmers than starting each length with a target distance for pushoffs.  Setting a minimum required distance makes sure the kids are doing what they're supposed to on each length.  From there, it's much easier to make sure they're doing the rest correctly.</p><p><strong>What we liked best about our visit:<br>R: </strong> It's been a while since I've been asked to jump in and coach. Dave Gibson let me take a group and spend a practice with them. It's was so fun to work with a group of swimmers...especially swimmers who were so happy and obviously wanting to improve. It was a great visit on my end!<br><strong>G:</strong> Hanging with Dave and Jennifer Gibson.  We've been good friends a long time, and it always amazes me, that the people who have been coaching the longest, are the ones who are seeking new ideas the most.  Not only was it enjoyable just to see friends, but it was great being able to share some of the details of what we've really learned on our trip.</p><p><strong>How is this team unique:<br>R: </strong> It is rare to find a fairly new team being headed up by such experienced coaches. Dave and Jennifer are doing a great job building up a wonderful program with an uncertain pool future. But spending time with them and the team I know that they have everything in order to keep this team moving onward and upward.<br><strong>G:</strong> The history of the facility, the knowledge of the coaches, the proximity to the beach, and the ample supply of lane space.  This makes this a very unique facility in which to create training that engages swimmers.  These are some lucky swimmers in my opinion.</p><p><strong>Our take-a-way:<br>R: </strong> We have seen it again and again. The best, most experienced coaches are always looking for ways to learn and grow. This visit was a reminder that no matter how long you have been in the coaching game, there are always things to learn. Dave and Jennifer's interest in what we have seen and learned on this journey was very motivating to me and is something I will take with me when I am back on deck full time in a few months.<br><strong>G:</strong> The real lesson here is how Dave and Jennifer have continued to stay focused and remained focused on their swimmers in some chaos that's been surrounding this facility.  Seems like things have calmed down, and they're in a great situation to really push things forward.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">ourquest</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
